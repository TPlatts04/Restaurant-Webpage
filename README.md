# Non-Interactive Restaurant-Webpage Using Only HTML + CSS

# Description
This is a small project which outlines my basic knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. The project highlighted in this repository is a basic webpage for an online restaurant where you are able to order food that are shown on a pre-designed menu. It also includes a small about section showing how many followers on social media the company has, while also describing what their aim is for their customers and business.
I used HTML5 and CSS3 within this project because i am expanding my knowledge and taking my first steps to become a Front-End developer. 
There were a few challenges which i had faced within this project, however i overcame these. One of the main challenges was getting around how a flexbox works compared to a basic grid. I overcame this challenge by outlining the borders in each box/grid to ensure i understand which is which, and any problems i came towards, i used knowledgable websites to find my answers (Stackoverflow, Github, W3Schools).

# Usage Of Project
To use and view this project i recommend using VS Code (Visual Studio Code) to load the files and link all of the CSS together. From there onwards, you can download an extension in VS Code known as Live Preview which is designed by Microsoft. This then allows you to view the live website within the IDE via clicking: ![image](https://github.com/TPlatts04/Restaurant-Webpage/assets/67462990/2ad67947-79fe-41aa-9749-8bbcad0a0d54) this small button (highlighted in red) in line with the file name.
Alternatively you can run this project in a web browser by downloading an extension in VS Code known as Live Server, where then you can right-click in any area of code and click 'Open with Live Server'.
**You will** need to ensure that all of the program files are in the same parent folder otherwise the CSS will not link to the main HTML file.
